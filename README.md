Create your characters, manually (select a class and a color) or not.   
Each player will play a turn until one wins, starting from their spawn until their character dies, becomes stuck or wins.  
A turn consists of:  
-choosing a weapon;  
-revealing a tile and acting accordingly;  
-moving on or going back to the spawn;  
This repeats until the turn ends.  
The game ends when one player discovers both their class' artifact and at least one chest in the same turn.  
Once the game ends, restart with the same parameters with 'r' or return to the menu.
